# SaltLoginTest

## Overview
First, I would like to thank people from Salt for giving me this opportunity. Btw, I forgot the fact that I have updated my device to the latest beta.
There is a great chance that none of people from Salt have updated their XCode, if that is the case, I would like to be notified so that I can find a
solution.
I am sorry for the fact that I did not make a regular update to the Repository and instead just push the whole finished project, I feel a single page
project does not need a fine and granular Git push.

## REQUIREMENT
XCODE 14 BETA

## Instalation Guide
```
git clone https://github.com/reyhanl/SatlTest.git
```
1. Clone this repository
2. Run the project
3. Login using `eve.holt@reqres.in` as the email, and any password other than empty String.

## Tech Used
1. MVVM

## Elements

### `TextField`
This custom textfield that I made is really elegant and easy to implement. You can set its PlaceHolder by using the Attribute Inspector, its PlaceHolder
is also animated to make the App seems more Interactable.
